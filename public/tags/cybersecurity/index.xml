      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, fellas, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been asked a more repetitive question before. It&amp;rsquo;s always &amp;ldquo;How can I break into Cybersecurity&amp;rdquo; and never &amp;ldquo;How is Damian doing&amp;rdquo;. I get asked how to break into this field more times than I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the rise of the sun.&lt;br&gt;
This is why I have created this guide. It&amp;rsquo;s notes taken from my personal experience and advice from more experienced professionals in the field, resources listed here are also free!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
