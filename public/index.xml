&lt;p&gt;My name is Damian, an Ethical Hacker/Penetration Tester with years of experience in the Cybersecurity field and interest in Web 3 Security. In my spare time, I take on CTF challenges and build projects in the Rust Programming Language. I particularly test the security of web applications and networks, coupled with my experience with cloud services.&lt;br&gt;
In addition, I am an educator and an ex Instructor at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/Cyblackorg?ref=damnsec.com&#34;&gt;CyBlack&lt;/a&gt; x &lt;strong&gt;Cisco&lt;/strong&gt; Academy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re trying to learn the art of exploitation, the way of &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, and have the esoteric knowledge to bend the internet to your will, juiced on energy drinks and dressed in a hoodie in a room so dark the only ray of light in there is green text emanating from your PC screen&amp;hellip;just to be used as your household&amp;rsquo;s IT technician?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have just the thing for you in this blog—a path filled with pain, and excitement–a never-ending journey of learning &amp;amp; discovery.&lt;br&gt;
Let&amp;rsquo;s become hackers, ethically of course.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Hey, I got your number from a friend. He said I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t tell you he was the one who gave me your number&amp;rdquo;, Whether it&amp;rsquo;s an annoying DM from some random like this, someone threatening you, a scammer, a crazy ex who won&amp;rsquo;t leave you alone, or just out of curiosity–we all want to know who exactly it is we&amp;rsquo;re chatting with over the phone.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, fellas, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been asked a more repetitive question before. It&amp;rsquo;s always &amp;ldquo;How can I break into Cybersecurity&amp;rdquo; and never &amp;ldquo;How is Damian doing&amp;rdquo;. I get asked how to break into this field more times than I&amp;rsquo;ve seen the rise of the sun.&lt;br&gt;
This is why I have created this guide. It&amp;rsquo;s notes taken from my personal experience and advice from more experienced professionals in the field, resources listed here are also free!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
