The movies do a poor portrayal of what this is. I found myself in this space, trying to see the computer like Mr. Robot sees it. I was a fool. A boy with a target, without a steady hand, trigger happy, eager to shoot–I did, I missed.\nMy mindset was wrong, what I knew was wrong.\nI had to change.\nI had to learn.\nThe serious version of that entire melodramatic text; the message I was trying to pass is you have to unlearn what you know and give way for new information.\nI knew hacking was a thing, but the term “Cybersecurity” was new. Who knew I could hack legally and make money too?\nYou have to think like a hacker. This is where your mind begins to take shape. You will question everything.\n“Why?” “How?” “And?” “What if?” “What else?” “Will it?”\nBut what exactly would you question? Do you know what is possible to begin questioning what else is possible?\nWhere do you even start? Let us find out.\nArm Yourself Before we begin, I have listed sources to get you started in the fundamentals of Cybersecurity. You can read my blog on this here. Without this, you can’t continue with the resources listed here.\nThis section of the blog focuses on FREE resources for practising. A balance of theoretical and practical knowledge to get you from zero to people asking rubbish like if you could hack someone for them. You will become impressive to the normies.\n1.) TryHackMe I wish I started with this instead of aimlessly trying and bricking my system each time. TryHackMe has a blog called Free TryHackMe Training: The Ultimate Guide for Beginners. As the name implies, it’s free and contains a list of free rooms where you can learn and practice Offensive Security/Hacking skills.\nFrom there, you should try to hack their machines. They are purposefully vulnerable computers you can practice your skills on.\n2.) Portswigger Academy Portswigger Academy is a web application security-based resource. It will teach you how to exploit web application vulnerabilities, why they exist and even suggest how to secure a website against attackers trying to exploit them.\n3.) HackTheBox Like TryHackMe and PortSwigger, Hack The Box is an academy-style platform with CTF-style challenges (more on this later).\nThere are a lot of resources on HackTheBox and this is my suggested path:\nHackTheBox Academy: Upon sign-up, you get 30 cubes for FREE which you can use to purchase courses/modules. I suggest you purchase 3 of these tier 0 courses, 10 cubes each. They are ‘Learning Process’, ‘Linux Fundamentals’ and ‘Introduction to Networking’. After, go to HTB Labs, and navigate to the Starting Point. This page has very easy machines/labs (purposefully vulnerable computers) to test your skills. They also have attached PDFs you can go through when you are stuck. The PDFs each contain a detailed walkthrough of the relevant machines. Then, if you can afford it, I suggest you get a 1 month VIP subscription. This gives you access to the retired easy machines and the guided mode option which is quite helpful. If you don’t want to or can’t afford the VIP subscription, you can get right into the active machines. That’s just where you should start. These can make you advanced in Web and Networking Penetration Testing/Ethical Hacking or becoming an elite TV remote repair man.\nThere are other resources. Like OffSec Proving Grounds, Pentester Labs, Cybrary and so on.\nWhat about videos? Yeah, I gotchu.\nRecommended YouTube Channels This is in no particular order. They are YouTube channels focused on Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking and Privacy.\nNetworkChuck\nHackersploit\nThe Cyber Mentor (TCM Security)\nJohn Hammond\nLiveOverflow\nIppsec\n0xdf\nMental Outlaw\nSeytonic (My favourite Cybersecurity/Hacking News channel)\nSTÖK (Bug Bounty)\nInsiderPhD\nNahamSec\nThe list goes on forever and as you begin consuming their content, you begin discovering other channels like these.\nCertificates There are a lot of debates around certificates. Whether you should get one or don’t get one or give specific ones you should get for your money’s worth. Let’s talk about them a little.\nA few of these are simply HR bypasses but some are, by popular opinion, worth it in order to gain skills. I’ll give a list and leave you to do your own research.\neLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) - Entry Level\nPractical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT) - Entry Level\nPractical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) - Entry Level\nCertified Edible Hamburger (CEH) - Entry Level\nOffSec Certified Professional (OSCP) - Mid-Seniour Level\neLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT) - Mid-Seniour Level\nHTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (HTB CPTS) - Mid-Seniour Level\nThe list goes on, but these are trendy and you will find most of them in job descriptions, a lot.\nNetwork With People, Make Friends I have a list of people you can follow on Twitter (X) who post relevant content on this. They form my Ethical Hacking community as well. Give them a follow and improve your TL.\n@Tib3rius\n@I_Am_Jakoby\n@runasand\n@TaelurAlexis\n@0dayCTF\n@TCMSecurity\n@seclilc\n@TheBlindHacker\n@shenetworks\n@GarrGhar\n@endingwithali\n@WhiteOakSec\n@JackRhysider\n@shehackspurple\n@_JohnHammond\n@InsiderPhD\n@PhillipWylie\n@joehelle\n@Alh4zr3d\n@rana__khalil\n@NahamSec\n@Jhaddix\n@ippsec\nThis particular list is of Nigerians in the field:\n@ireteeh\n@akintunero\n@sisinerdtweets\n@commando_skiipz\n@Hac10101\n@Debug_sec\n@Sec_fortress\n@r007User\n@_Rega_n\n@kellyscholas\n@deusx_45\n@g3ntry1\n@daltsec\n@Queenicea17\n@Ahmed___khaan\n@RedHatPentester\n@Olufela_Jr\n@OluwaseyiAjadi4\n@Dghost_Ninja\n@Mustaph99035272\nThere are so many people I could add to this list. All wonderful and helpful people in the community.\nConclusion \u0026 Stuff The road to becoming a hacker doesn’t exist. There are many roads, many paths. This is just an attempt to help create one for you in the most cost-free way possible.\nThere are other related career paths in Offensive Security, like Penetration Testing, Red Teamer, Security Engineer, Threat Intelligence Analysts, etc.\nIt’s going to be hard. You’re going to study a lot, but it is achievable. Take your time and learn and you will be fine. Do not give up.\nThanks for reading, I hope you’ve learnt something here!\nFAQ Q: Do I need to learn programming to become a hacker?\nA: Short answer, yes. I recommend learning Python and BASH.\nQ: How much do Ethical Hackers make?\nA: DYOR. It varies for a lot of factors like location, company’s budget, experience, etc\nQ: Can you hack my gf’s WhatsApp?\nA: Yeah, for $100,000,000. LMAO go away.\n",

I knew hacking was a thing, but the term &ldquo;Cybersecurity&rdquo; was new. Who knew I could hack legally and make money too?</p>
<p>You have to think like a hacker. This is where your mind begins to take shape. You will question everything.<br>
&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; &ldquo;How?&rdquo; &ldquo;And?&rdquo; &ldquo;What if?&rdquo; &ldquo;What else?&rdquo; &ldquo;Will it?&rdquo;<br>
But what exactly would you question? Do you know what is possible to begin questioning what <em>else</em> is possible?<br>
Where do you even start? Let us find out.</p>

<p>Before we begin, I have listed sources to get you started in the fundamentals of Cybersecurity. You can read my blog on this <a href="https://www.damnsec.com/how-to-get-started-in-cybersecurity/">here</a>. Without this, you can&rsquo;t continue with the resources listed here.</p>
<p>This section of the blog focuses on FREE resources for practising. A balance of theoretical and practical knowledge to get you from zero to people asking rubbish like if you could hack someone for them. You will become impressive to the normies.</p>
<h3 id="1-tryhackme">1.) TryHackMe<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#1-tryhackme">#</a></h3>
<p><img alt="TryHackMe" loading="lazy" src="https://assets.tryhackme.com/img/logo/tryhackme_logo_full.svg"></p>
<p>I wish I started with this instead of aimlessly trying and bricking my system each time. TryHackMe has a blog called <a href="https://tryhackme.com/r/resources/blog/free_path?ref=damnsec.com">Free TryHackMe Training: The Ultimate Guide for Beginners</a>. As the name implies, it&rsquo;s free and contains a list of free rooms where you can learn and practice Offensive Security/Hacking skills.</p>
<p>From there, you should <em>try to hack</em> their <em>machines</em>. They are purposefully vulnerable computers you can practice your skills on.</p>
<h3 id="2-portswigger-academy">2.) Portswigger Academy<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#2-portswigger-academy">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="https://portswigger.net/web-security/?ref=damnsec.com">Portswigger Academy</a> is a web application security-based resource. It will teach you how to exploit web application vulnerabilities, why they exist and even suggest how to secure a website against attackers trying to exploit them.</p>

<p>Like TryHackMe and PortSwigger, <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/?ref=damnsec.com">Hack The Box</a> is an academy-style platform with CTF-style challenges (more on this later).</p>
<p>There are a lot of resources on HackTheBox and this is my suggested path:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://referral.hackthebox.com/mz8sC8T?ref=damnsec.com">HackTheBox Academy</a>: Upon sign-up, you get 30 cubes for FREE which you can use to purchase courses/modules. I suggest you purchase 3 of these tier 0 courses, 10 cubes each. They are &lsquo;Learning Process&rsquo;, &lsquo;Linux Fundamentals&rsquo; and &lsquo;Introduction to Networking&rsquo;.</li>
<li>After, go to <a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/?ref=damnsec.com">HTB Labs</a>, and navigate to the <a href="https://app.hackthebox.com/starting-point?ref=damnsec.com">Starting Point</a>. This page has very easy machines/labs (purposefully vulnerable computers) to test your skills. They also have attached PDFs you can go through when you are stuck. The PDFs each contain a detailed walkthrough of the relevant machines.</li>
<li>Then, if you can afford it, I suggest you get a 1 month VIP subscription. This gives you access to the retired easy machines and the <a href="https://www.hackthebox.com/blog/guided-mode?ref=damnsec.com">guided mode</a> option which is quite helpful.</li>
<li>If you don&rsquo;t want to or can&rsquo;t afford the VIP subscription, you can get right into the active machines.</li>
</ul>
<p>That&rsquo;s just where you should start. These can make you advanced in Web and Networking Penetration Testing/Ethical Hacking or becoming an elite TV remote repair man.<br>
There are other resources. Like <a href="https://www.offsec.com/labs/?ref=damnsec.com">OffSec Proving Grounds</a>, <a href="https://pentesterlab.com/?ref=damnsec.com">Pentester Labs</a>, <a href="https://www.cybrary.it/free-content?ref=damnsec.com">Cybrary</a> and so on.</p>
<p>What about videos? Yeah, I gotchu.</p>

<h3 id="certificates">Certificates<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#certificates">#</a></h3>
<p>There are a lot of debates around certificates. Whether you should get one or don&rsquo;t get one or give specific ones you should get for your money&rsquo;s worth. Let&rsquo;s talk about them a little.</p>
<p>A few of these are simply HR bypasses but some are, by popular opinion, worth it in order to gain skills. I&rsquo;ll give a list and leave you to do your own research.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion--stuff">Conclusion &amp; Stuff<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion--stuff">#</a></h2>
<p>The road to becoming a hacker doesn&rsquo;t exist. There are many roads, many paths. This is just an attempt to help create one for you in the most cost-free way possible.<br>
There are other related career paths in Offensive Security, like Penetration Testing, Red Teamer, Security Engineer, Threat Intelligence Analysts, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s going to be hard. You&rsquo;re going to study a lot, but it is achievable. Take your time and learn and you will be fine. Do not give up.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, I hope you&rsquo;ve learnt something here!</p>
