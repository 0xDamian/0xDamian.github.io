The movies do a poor portrayal of what this is. I found myself in this space, trying to see the computer like Mr. Robot sees it. I was a fool. A boy with a target, without a steady hand, trigger happy, eager to shoot‚ÄìI did, I missed.\nMy mindset was wrong, what I knew was wrong.\nI had to change.\nI had to learn.\nThe serious version of that entire melodramatic text; the message I was trying to pass is you have to unlearn what you know and give way for new information.\nI knew hacking was a thing, but the term \u0026ldquo;Cybersecurity\u0026rdquo; was new. Who knew I could hack legally and make money too?\nYou have to think like a hacker. This is where your mind begins to take shape. You will question everything.\n\u0026ldquo;Why?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;How?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;And?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What if?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;What else?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Will it?\u0026rdquo;\nBut what exactly would you question? Do you know what is possible to begin questioning what else is possible?\nWhere do you even start? Let us find out.\nArm Yourself Before we begin, I have listed sources to get you started in the fundamentals of Cybersecurity. You can read my blog on this here. Without this, you can\u0026rsquo;t continue with the resources listed here.\nThis section of the blog focuses on FREE resources for practising. A balance of theoretical and practical knowledge to get you from zero to people asking rubbish like if you could hack someone for them. You will become impressive to the normies.\n1.) TryHackMe I wish I started with this instead of aimlessly trying and bricking my system each time. TryHackMe has a blog called Free TryHackMe Training: The Ultimate Guide for Beginners. As the name implies, it\u0026rsquo;s free and contains a list of free rooms where you can learn and practice Offensive Security/Hacking skills.\nFrom there, you should try to hack their machines. They are purposefully vulnerable computers you can practice your skills on.\n2.) Portswigger Academy Portswigger Academy is a web application security-based resource. It will teach you how to exploit web application vulnerabilities, why they exist and even suggest how to secure a website against attackers trying to exploit them.\n3.) HackTheBox Like TryHackMe and PortSwigger, Hack The Box is an academy-style platform with CTF-style challenges (more on this later).\nThere are a lot of resources on HackTheBox and this is my suggested path:\nHackTheBox Academy: Upon sign-up, you get 30 cubes for FREE which you can use to purchase courses/modules. I suggest you purchase 3 of these tier 0 courses, 10 cubes each. They are \u0026lsquo;Learning Process\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Linux Fundamentals\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Introduction to Networking\u0026rsquo;. After, go to HTB Labs, and navigate to the Starting Point. This page has very easy machines/labs (purposefully vulnerable computers) to test your skills. They also have attached PDFs you can go through when you are stuck. The PDFs each contain a detailed walkthrough of the relevant machines. Then, if you can afford it, I suggest you get a 1 month VIP subscription. This gives you access to the retired easy machines and the guided mode option which is quite helpful. If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to or can\u0026rsquo;t afford the VIP subscription, you can get right into the active machines. That\u0026rsquo;s just where you should start. These can make you advanced in Web and Networking Penetration Testing/Ethical Hacking or becoming an elite TV remote repair man.\nThere are other resources. Like OffSec Proving Grounds, Pentester Labs, Cybrary and so on.\nWhat about videos? Yeah, I gotchu.\nRecommended YouTube Channels This is in no particular order. They are YouTube channels focused on Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking and Privacy.\nNetworkChuck\nHackersploit\nThe Cyber Mentor (TCM Security)\nJohn Hammond\nLiveOverflow\nIppsec\n0xdf\nMental Outlaw\nSeytonic (My favourite Cybersecurity/Hacking News channel)\nST√ñK (Bug Bounty)\nInsiderPhD\nNahamSec\nThe list goes on forever and as you begin consuming their content, you begin discovering other channels like these.\nCertificates There are a lot of debates around certificates. Whether you should get one or don\u0026rsquo;t get one or give specific ones you should get for your money\u0026rsquo;s worth. Let\u0026rsquo;s talk about them a little.\nA few of these are simply HR bypasses but some are, by popular opinion, worth it in order to gain skills. I\u0026rsquo;ll give a list and leave you to do your own research.\neLearnSecurity Junior Penetration Tester (eJPT) - Entry Level\nPractical Junior Penetration Tester (PJPT) - Entry Level\nPractical Network Penetration Tester (PNPT) - Entry Level\nCertified Edible Hamburger (CEH) - Entry Level\nOffSec Certified Professional (OSCP) - Mid-Seniour Level\neLearnSecurity Certified Professional Penetration Tester (eCPPT) - Mid-Seniour Level\nHTB Certified Penetration Testing Specialist (HTB CPTS) - Mid-Seniour Level\nThe list goes on, but these are trendy and you will find most of them in job descriptions, a lot.\nNetwork With People, Make Friends I have a list of people you can follow on Twitter (X) who post relevant content on this.

All wonderful and helpful people in the community.\nConclusion \u0026amp; Stuff The road to becoming a hacker doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. There are many roads, many paths. This is just an attempt to help create one for you in the most cost-free way possible.\nThere are other related career paths in Offensive Security, like Penetration Testing, Red Teamer, Security Engineer, Threat Intelligence Analysts, etc.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s going to be hard. You\u0026rsquo;re going to study a lot, but it is achievable. Take your time and learn and you will be fine. Do not give up.\nThanks for reading, I hope you\u0026rsquo;ve learnt something here!\nFAQ Q: Do I need to learn programming to become a hacker?\nA: Short answer, yes. I recommend learning Python and BASH.\nQ: How much do Ethical Hackers make?\nA: DYOR. It varies for a lot of factors like location, company\u0026rsquo;s budget, experience, etc\nQ: Can you hack my gf\u0026rsquo;s WhatsApp?\nA: Yeah, for $100,000,000.

He said I shouldn\u0026rsquo;t tell you he was the one who gave me your number\u0026rdquo;, Whether it\u0026rsquo;s an annoying DM from some random like this, someone threatening you, a scammer, a crazy ex who won\u0026rsquo;t leave you alone, or just out of curiosity‚Äìwe all want to know who exactly it is we\u0026rsquo;re chatting with over the phone.\nRight now, Gojo is floating over Lagos. He\u0026rsquo;s looking for some special grade cursed spirit called \u0026ldquo;Femi\u0026rdquo;. Apparently, women from all of Nigeria have encountered it (mostly in Lagos) and have warned against it for years. He has the six-eyes to help him find Femi, but we can help. How? Well, we can use\u0026hellip;\nOpen-Source Intelligence OSINT, for short, is a practice where you collect publicly available information to complete an objective. When adopted, the usual aim is to find a person.\nWe can use this skill to help Gojo, so let\u0026rsquo;s get through how it\u0026rsquo;s done.\nHow would you begin collecting public information about someone who randomly DM\u0026rsquo;d you? It\u0026rsquo;s simple really. Scaringly so.\nFirst Step People tend to rely on Truecaller. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know what Truecaller is, it\u0026rsquo;s an app that helps identify a caller. But you see, there\u0026rsquo;s a problem with this app.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not exactly a problem with the app per se, it\u0026rsquo;s the fact that people do not understand how it works. You see, Truecaller does help identify who\u0026rsquo;s calling, but the truth is it only knows who the caller is because the caller told Truecaller who they were.\nWhat I mean is, that upon registering on Truecaller, people are often compelled to use their legal name, given the registration process. What they do not know is you do not have to do that. You can use an alias.\nThe image above shows what you would see if you searched one of my numbers‚Äîan alias.\nFor this reason alone, Truecaller isn\u0026rsquo;t all that reliable.\nSo what could we use to guarantee or nearly guarantee that we see the correct name of the person?\nMobile Money Operators Yup, your Opay, and Palmpay alike. This should be obvious, but it turns out that not many people think of these as OSINT tools. They just use it to pay the Instagram scam vendor and go on with their day.\nThe thing is, a lot of people use Opay now. Since traditional banking services are as efficient as using a pigeon to send messages, we\u0026rsquo;ve come to leave them behind and move on to M.M.Os. And since that\u0026rsquo;s the case, why not use that to find out who you\u0026rsquo;re talking to? Unconventional, but that\u0026rsquo;s the point of this blog. We\u0026rsquo;ll use not-so-known \u0026ldquo;tools\u0026rdquo; to work for us. So, what else?\nMy Airtel App This one isn\u0026rsquo;t well known, but it works for Airtel numbers. This is how it\u0026rsquo;s done.\nOn the My Airtel app, click on the \u0026lsquo;Recharge\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Buy Bundles\u0026rsquo; option and type in an Airtel number in the input field. That\u0026rsquo;s it. This would give you the name of the person who registered the SIM. Image below is an example using my sister\u0026rsquo;s number.\nDo you see how much info you can get just by doing these? It\u0026rsquo;s incredible.\nBut OSINT isn\u0026rsquo;t just about getting a name, however, I understand how important names are, there\u0026rsquo;s a lot more you could do the more you know about the person. How about finding out what phone model the person is using?\nWhatsApp I bet you didn\u0026rsquo;t see this one coming. You can use WhatsApp to find the model of someone\u0026rsquo;s phone. This could help you narrow down the person\u0026rsquo;s interests. Once again, the more you know about the target, the better. I mean, I wanna know what phone Femi is using to terrorise our women too. How\u0026rsquo;s it done, though? It\u0026rsquo;s easy. Get another WhatsApp app (probably business or the normal one if you have WhatsApp business) or WhatsApp on another phone and then try to login with the person\u0026rsquo;s number. Sure, this would alert the person that someone is attempting to login, but you get the information you want. Image below tested with my WhatsApp number.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s one of those things you just don\u0026rsquo;t think of. It\u0026rsquo;s amazing.\nWhat About Email OSINT? Sometimes, you get the email of the person Or just the username. I have grown to really like a tool called Blackbird and it\u0026rsquo;s interesting what this thing can pull up.\nBlackbird results after testing on my email\nOf course, it\u0026rsquo;s not the only tool I use. There\u0026rsquo;s another one called Ghunt. This only works for Gmail, however, unlike Blackbird.\nEven with just a username, Blackbird is quite effective.\nBlackbird result after testing my alias\nNow, you know I\u0026rsquo;m interested in Programming, learning languages that have nothing to do with me, Chess, Hacking (duh), etc. While it\u0026rsquo;s not entirely accurate, you can see that it\u0026rsquo;s good enough.\nNB: Blackbird also has an AI feature that I will test and update this blog with.\nMISC The rest of this article could be me yapping about common methods, but I\u0026rsquo;ll just gloss over \u0026rsquo;em.\nOnce I\u0026rsquo;ve got a name, the next thing I do is check that name on Google. Then check Facebook and LinkedIn. Maybe Twitter too, but less likely to bring results compared to the other two sources. You could also do this with a number, but do this on Twitter. There\u0026rsquo;s a nice chance the target has posted their Opay/Palmpay banking details on there for some giveaway or something.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also image OSINT. You could use Google Lens or Yandex to search for a face. But faces aren\u0026rsquo;t the only thing to look for in images. You could use that to find the location, judging from what\u0026rsquo;s in the image and also extract Metadata using the CLI tool called exiftool.\nDisclaimer While this would be really useful in helping Gojo find Femi the special-grade cursed spirit, it\u0026rsquo;d be quite annoying to find people using this knowledge to bully/scare innocent people into doing stuff. I have withheld some cheeky tricks, but I might update this blog with them one day.\nAct responsibly and have fun finding Femi!

It\u0026rsquo;s always \u0026ldquo;How can I break into Cybersecurity\u0026rdquo; and never \u0026ldquo;How is Damian doing\u0026rdquo;. I get asked how to break into this field more times than I\u0026rsquo;ve seen the rise of the sun.\nThis is why I have created this guide. It\u0026rsquo;s notes taken from my personal experience and advice from more experienced professionals in the field, resources listed here are also free!\nBaby Steps First Look, the thing about Cybersecurity, like any other career path is you can\u0026rsquo;t skip the basics.\nComputer Basics\nThis is just understanding how to use a computer at the very least. In this day and age, everyone can, but can you USE a computer?\nWhat I mean is, that using a computer to watch anime or play a game amongst other \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; things, puts you in the category of the average consumer.\nA particular resource to get you ahead of the normies would be Professor Messer\u0026rsquo;s CompTIA A+ YouTube series. It\u0026rsquo;s free and will teach you the basics of computer Hardware, Software, Troubleshooting and so on.\nNetworking This is the oxygen to your hydrogens. It\u0026rsquo;s essential to make your understanding of Cybersecurity concepts flow like water.\nTo understand why you have to do Cybersecurity in the first place, you have to understand the way computers communicate, which is what Networking is about. You can learn the basics using the following resources:\n1. Professor Messer\u0026rsquo;s Network+ free YouTube series\n2. NetAcad Network Basics\nLinux Windows systems dominate the consumer market. Y\u0026rsquo;know, the normies, but other operating systems (OS) exist like the MacOS, and a core focus in the Cybersecurity industry, Linux operating systems.\nWhile Windows systems and MacBooks dominate the consumer market (yeah, the normies), Linux dominates somewhere else; the Internet. A vast majority of the internet runs on a Linux-based operating system and a lot of the tools used by Cybersecurity professionals are found in Linux systems as well.\nWhile any of the mentioned OSs could perform well for a Cybersecurity professional, I find Linux to be much easier to use.\nHere are resources you can learn Linux from:\n1. LinuxJourney\n2. FreeCodeCamp Intro To Linux YouTube Playlist\nCybersecurity Concepts/Practices Understanding what the deal is with Cybersecurity shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to be mentioned, but let me properly direct you to the recommended resources:\n1. TryHackMe\u0026rsquo;s Intro to Cybersecurity path\n2. Professor Messer\u0026rsquo;s Security+ YouTube series\nProgramming (Just a lil ü§èüèæüëÄ) I understand that a lot of people want to avoid this, but please don\u0026rsquo;t. Especially if you want to get into a technical role in the industry. In my experience, I have noticed how much programming becomes quite relevant as I advance in my career.\nThat said, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to become some super programmer. The least you should be able to do is read code and write small scripts to make your workload lighter through automation.\nSpeaking of automation, I recommend that you learn Python and BASH (some HTML and JavaScript wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt). Program small projects to get the hang of it. It also looks great on your resume/portfolio.\nWhere to learn?\n1. FreeCodeCamp\n2. BASH Academy\nDone with the basics? Let\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip;\nFind Your Niche ![[static/blog/Start-Cyber/img5.png]]\nYou\u0026rsquo;ve found out about Cybersecurity and chances are, you want to become a hacker. It sounds fun, doesn\u0026rsquo;t it? Let\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip;back up a little.\nThere are numerous Cybersecurity paths, it\u0026rsquo;s quite ridiculous.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve got Pentesting, GRC, Red Teaming, Blue Teaming, Purple Teaming, Technical Writing, Cybersecurity Engineering, SOC Analysis, Cybersecurity Sales, and that\u0026rsquo;s just scratching the surface.\nThe large amount of roles may be daunting and it can be hard to figure out which one you want, but here\u0026rsquo;s how you could do it:\nResearch.\nYup, you have to do some research on what these various roles mean. How I would do it is simply Google it and then see if there are videos about the role. I\u0026rsquo;d listen to professionals about what it takes to work in that role, such as skillset and activities and then I would build on it by practicing. Worked out fine for me.\nAnother thing is to figure out if you like technical roles or non-technical roles. This helps narrow down the ideal job type for you.\nWanna get hired now? Of course, you do. But first, you need to\u0026hellip;\nGet Certified For each role, there are several industry-standard certifications and there are general certificates as well (regardless of the role). These certificates, depending on where you\u0026rsquo;re from and the level of difficulty of the exam would typically dictate how pricy it would be.\nThese general certs are:\n1. CompTIA Security+\n2. CompTIA Network+\n3. CompTIA Cysa+\n4. CEH (Not a fan)\n5. eJPT\n6. OSCP\n7.
